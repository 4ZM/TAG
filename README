TAG is an art work created during the Art Hack Day in Stockholm (April
2013).

Use the TAG Android app to draw and create. Then write your work to an
SL Access card. Use the TAG app again to read and view the image
stored on a card. Shake the phone to clear the screen.

The image is stored on, what seems to be, some unused storage space on
the SL Access cards. There are no guarantees in life, but test have
shown that the tagged cards continue to work as usual in the public
transport system.

To use the app, you have to allow unsigned apps and enable NFC on your
device.
